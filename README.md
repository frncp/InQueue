InQueue is a small **web application** aimed at helping people with **booking a service in their area**.  
This is a university project made for the 2021 edition of the Tecnologie Web (Web Technologies) course at the [*Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Parthenope*](https://github.com/uniparthenope).

## How to get started
### Setting up the database
1. Create a MongoDB database
2. Create a file named *`passwords.py`* in the root folder and insert the following  parameters
    - `DB_USER = your_DB_username` (the name of the database user)
    - `DB_PASSWORD = your_DB_password` (the password for the database user)

### Installing the requirements
1. Open your terminal in the root folder
2. Install Python 3 on your machine if you haven't it installed already.
    
    To find out if you have Python 3 installed type `python3 --version` and press enter.

    To install Python 3 on your machine, follow the [instructions given here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Create a virtual envirorment by giving the command `python3 -m venv env`
4. Install all the requirements with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Executing
1. Type `python3 app.py` to start the server
2. Open your browser and reach the page [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
3. ????
